## comparison of CSR and SSR

In my opinion, it is better to fetch data using the server side, because the data displayed is like there is no loading at all, this will be very suitable when we will display data that does not change often. Because the data will be the same for every user of the site, it will be much more efficient if the data is loaded once on the server rather than having to be loaded one by one by each client.

If the data on a site changes frequently, then client-side data retrieval techniques may be a good fit.
